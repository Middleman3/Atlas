/**
 * The atlas._Entity is a Domain Model object. It is the
 * building block of the application. Examples of
 * atlas.Entities are  objects. As a rule of thumb, if you take two
 * very different applications, yet they have a few similar
 * objects with the same name (objects like Customer,
 * Product, and Order) those objects are atlas.Entities of the
 * Domain Model. Somewhere between the Application details
 * and the Architecture concepts.
 *
 * The atlas.Entities live in the Domain Layer, which has no
 * connection to the database, UI, or anything other than
 * the Application Layer, implemented by the atlas._UseCase class.
 * The atlas._UseCase is the Bridge between the Domain Layer
 * atlas.Entities, and everything else.
